Logic behind the code:
Step 1) Understanding the problem:
The ptoblem says that to identify the nutrients in the dish
Step 2) We know that Clarifai APi food model can give us ingridients of food by recognizing image
Hit the clarifai API and checj the response in browser.It is showing some values ranging from 0-1.Since it works on predictions
So it displays higher values first 
Step 3) Build the solution
Create an array of proteins ,carbs ,vitamins ,fats items and initialize it with all possible  food items.
now iterate the ingredients upto the length of array of ingriedients and find whether any ingridient is present in any of the four arrays
Create a function which is returning the string if the ingridient is found in any of the array . Catch the response of that function in a variable
and display the value of that variable in template
